# Generative AI Chatbot using LangChain and Gradio

This project demonstrates a simple Generative AI chatbot built using the LangChain framework, Gradio interface, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot takes on the persona of Batman and engages with users in a conversational manner.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install langchain
pip install openai
pip install gradio
pip install huggingface_hub
```

## Setting Up API Keys

Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in the environment variable before running the script:

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "Keep_your_api_key_here"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Code Overview

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - Import necessary libraries such as `os`, `gradio`, `ChatOpenAI`, `LLMChain`, `PromptTemplate`, and `ConversationBufferMemory`.
   - Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable.

2. **Prompt Template**:
   - The chatbot is designed to respond like Batman. The template is structured to maintain chat history and generate responses based on the user's input.

3. **Memory**:
   - `ConversationBufferMemory` is used to store and maintain chat history, allowing the chatbot to have contextual conversations.

4. **LLMChain**:
   - `LLMChain` is configured with `ChatOpenAI` for generating responses using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chain also uses the defined prompt template and memory.

5. **Gradio Interface**:
   - A `Gradio` interface is set up to allow users to interact with the chatbot in a web-based chat interface. Predefined example prompts are provided.

6. **Launching the App**:
   - The app is launched using `demo.launch()`. To create a public link or enable logging, you can set `share=True` or `debug=True` in the `launch()` method.

## Running the App

To run the app locally, simply execute the script. The chatbot interface will be available in your browser.

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Usage

- Interact with the chatbot through the Gradio interface.
- Example prompts: "How are you doing?", "What are your interests?", "Which places do you like to visit?"
